## Manual
Running "main" will open the application. It will first check the specified location for the "books.csv" file, if it can't find that, it will show a message to select a .csv file. Please find that in the src/dataset folder of this project.

The application will load the data into a table, from which the user can select to switch the datastructure by use of radio buttons and a confirmation button.

The application will also be able to sort and search through the data entries. For this, another set of radio buttons and a confirmation button has been made.

The application doesn't want to reset back to natural order sorting, however, after performing a search, either for author or title, then the application will allow for natural order sorting to be performed.
